# pt-logos

Creates the foundational organizational structure — GCP folder hierarchy, Google Identity groups, GitHub teams and repositories, and Datadog teams. All downstream layers (corpus, pneuma) depend on its outputs.

- `teams/` — per-team tfvars files (e.g. `pt-corpus.tfvars`, `pt-pneuma.tfvars`) define each team's resources
- This repo is the source of truth consumed by `module.helpers` — it does not invoke a helpers module itself.

## Team Configuration Schema

`teams/example.tfvars` is the canonical schema reference for all team configuration options. **Any time a field is added, removed, or changed in `variables.tofu`, `teams/example.tfvars` must be updated to match** — including the field itself, its comment explaining purpose and valid values, and whether it is required or optional.

## GitHub Actions

Logos deploys only to production — on push to `main` and via `workflow_dispatch`. Each team's tfvars file is applied as a separate matrix job (e.g. `pt-corpus`, `pt-pneuma`).
